### Executive Summary
Determining whether business is credit-worthy is dependent on the character, capacity, capital, collateral, and conditions. To quantify these constituents and test their ability to satisfy set conditions requires an in-depth look into financial statements containing the operational history of the business, financial practices, its ability to pay back loans, and external economic factors. Using simulated data with missing values, this project used Excel, Python, and SQL to obtain useful metrics such as total debt to EBITDA, Interest Coverage Ratio, and Operating Cash Flow Coverage to ascertain the creditworthiness of a company. Furthermore, the simulated data was used to forecast the credit of a company to determine its financial stability.

### Key Creditworthiness Indicators
The following metrics were used to assess the financial stability of the simulated companies:

| Collateral Coverage Ratio |  |  |
